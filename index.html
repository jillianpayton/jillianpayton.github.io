        <p>Hello! I'm a microbiology major in my senior year, and this is my first time learning about code. I don't know very much about computers in general, so CS 1030 is already blowing my mind. Here's a little about me...</p>

        <p>Outside of school, I run an Etsy shop selling polymer clay charms (<a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/JillyBeanCharms">check it out here</a>), and I also tutor writing on Weber State's Davis campus. Both of these are very rewarding for me. I like making people happy and helping them build confidence in their own writing.</p>

        <p>I own a ton of plants (yeah, I'm one of those people). Here are a couple of them. Aren't they adorable?</p>
        
        <p>While I think computer science is pretty interesting, and coding is an extremely valuable skill to have, I definitely prefer majoring in microbiology. I knew I wanted to go into microbiology since sophomore year in high school. Now, I'm doing my second semester of undergraduate research! It's pretty cool. </p>

              <p>Are you blinded by the pink yet? Good. Alright, here's a table about bacteria for no reason. Enjoy!</p>
        
        <table style="width:100%">
        <tr>
            <th>Genus</th>   
            <th>Species</th>
            <th>Gram Stain</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Escherichia</td>
            <td>E. coli</td>
            <td>Negative</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Staphylococcus</td>
            <td>S. aureus</td>
